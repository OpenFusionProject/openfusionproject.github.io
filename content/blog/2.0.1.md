# OpenFusionLauncher v2.0.1

We're announcing the release of OpenFusionLauncher v2.0.1. This release contains a small batch of bug fixes and improvements. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on the initial v2.0.0 release.

## Details
This is a very minor update and most users will not notice a difference (those on Linux will benefit the most). As such, updating is not required to continue playing the game.

### Changelog
- Fixed the main.unity3d URL from build manifests being ignored.
- Fixed the custom titlebar (used on Linux) scrolling off the top of the window and gave the buttons a visual refresh.
- Fixed the login screen coming up twice on endpoint servers with multiple versions available when the "Remember Me" checkbox is not checked.
- Fixed the resource path being incorrectly set in certain Linux environments.
- Made the errors messages for common errors a little more clear & helpful.

Full changelog available [here](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher/compare/2.0.0...2.0.1)
