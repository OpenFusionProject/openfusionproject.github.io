# OpenFusionLauncher v2.1.1

We're announcing the release of OpenFusionLauncher v2.1.1.

## Texture loading woes

Has this ever happened to you?

If so, you may be eligible for for a new OpenFusionLauncher version!

This texture loading bug would happen when leaving the game minimized, and could potentially cause the game to crash completely. Both have been fixed in this release!

Much better.

We have also changed the auto-updater to point to the website, rather than the Github releases page.
