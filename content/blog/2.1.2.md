# OpenFusionLauncher v2.1.2

We're announcing the release of OpenFusionLauncher v2.1.2.

This release fixes auto-login on macOS. The issue was caused by a log file directory path containing spaces that weren't properly quoted.

With this release, the launcher will now also censor your login token in displayed error messages:

{{< figure
  src="images/2.1.2-token.png"
  alt="An error message being displayed in the launcher"
  caption="Notice how the text after `-t` is replaced with three asterisks."
>}}

This will prevent the rare case where if someone saw a screenshot with your token, they would be able to log in to your account (if done within 30 seconds).

### Changelog

Full changelog available [here](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher/compare/2.1.1...2.1.2).

## Download
The launcher can be grabbed from our [Downloads Page](https://openfusion.dev/download) or the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher/releases/tag/2.1.2).
