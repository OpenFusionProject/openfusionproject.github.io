# OpenFusionLauncher v2.0.2

We're announcing the release of OpenFusionLauncher v2.0.2. This fixes an issue where the Vulkan option in the Graphics API setting was not working as intended, causing OpenGL to be incorrectly used instead.

### Changelog
- Added the missing DLL required for Vulkan functionality
- Enabled the Vulkan debug overlay in debug builds

Full changelog available [here](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher/compare/2.0.1...2.0.2)

## Download
The new version of the launcher can be grabbed from our new [Downloads Page](https://openfusion.dev/download) or the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher/releases/tag/2.0.2).
