# OpenFusionLauncher v2.1.0

We're announcing the release of OpenFusionLauncher v2.1.0. This release comes with a number of bugfixes and the introduction of two new platforms that the launcher can run on. Read below for the details!

## AppImage support

One of the biggest issues we've faced with the new launcher is how difficult it was to get running on portable Linux devices such as the Steam Deck. This is mainly due to how immutable operating systems such as SteamOS and CachyOS work, where you cannot permanently install system dependencies that the launcher needs. You also needed to manually configure a compatiblity tool such as Wine or Proton in order for the game to work.

Shipping an AppImage bundles the aforementioned system dependencies - so now to run the launcher, all you need to do is download the single AppImage file, then click it to run. Nifty!

We've also added a feature to automatically detect a Proton installation if you're running on Steam Deck. This means that all you need to do is ensure a Proton version is installed from the Library tab, and the game should launch out right of the box!

One of our contributors, CakeLancelot, has uploaded a controller layout to use that maps all buttons and also incorporates gyro control. If you browse community layouts it should be one of the first results, but if you don't see it you can also manually apply it by clicking [here](steam://controllerconfig/OpenFusionLauncher/358542511).

## MacOS support

MacOS support has been something we've been testing in the background for a while, but now we've decided to finally bring it to the forefront! As of 2.1.0 you will be able to get the .dmg file straight from the downloads page.

Now, like AppImage support there are a few gotchas. Most notable is that you will need to install some version of Wine to the Applications folder first - I recommend [winecx](https://github.com/Gcenx/winecx/releases/tag/crossover-wine-23.7.1-1). You will then need to allow non-App Store programs to run in System Settings, finally **command click** the OpenFusionLauncher.app file and select 'Open'.

Game performance will be severely limited on Apple Silicon Macs, unfortunately this an Operating System / Wine limitation that we are not able to work around at this time. If you are wanting the best performance, then virtualizing the Windows version with VMWare or Parallels is still the way to go.
