# OpenFusionLauncher + OpenFusion v2.0

Happy Monday everyone!
Today we are proud to annouce the release of OpenFusion and OpenFusionLauncher version 2.0.
There is a lot to cover, so without any further ado, let's get started!

## OpenFusionLauncher

Introducing **OpenFusionLauncher**, a complete rewrite of OpenFusionClient.
OpenFusionLauncher supports everything OpenFusionClient does and more, with a bunch of new features and a visual refresh.
To establish OpenFusionLauncher as the successor to OpenFusionClient, it will start at version 2.0.
Although OpenFusionClient is currently still able to connect to the OpenFusion public servers, we will no longer be officially supporting it, so we encourage you to update as soon as possible.

### Endpoint Servers

Larger OpenFusion servers have a need for enhanced login features and version management.
These servers are known as **Endpoint Servers** and can be added to your server list with the "endpoint host" (provided to you by the server admins).
Endpoint servers support the following features:
* More secure login system
* Remember me option - unique per server entry
* Email recovery - never lose access to your account again!
* Account management to update password and email
* Message Of The Day feature to inform you about a server's latest updates
* Ability to customize the background and logo image displayed when a server is selected

You can still play on a private OpenFusion server by adding it as a **Simple Server** to your server list.
Your OpenFusionClient servers will also be automatically imported on first launch.
(If you would like to set up your OpenFusion server to be an endpoint server, check out [ofapi](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/ofapi).)

### New Settings

* Customize the location of your game cache and offline cache.
  * Previously, all of your game files would be stored in the same place on your machine.
  * You can now select which folders you'd like to use for both your game and offline caches.
  * This allows you to keep your game files on an external hard drive or other storage medium.
* Multiple graphics backends - choose between DX9, OpenGL, and Vulkan.
  * It is still recommended to use DX9 in almost all cases - however if you are on an Intel GPU, using Vulkan will fix artifacts with the character shadows.
  * Feel free to experiment and let us know what works best for you!
* Adjust the client window width and height set on launch to get the perfect size.
* Use the launch command option for more advanced tweaks.
  * On Windows, this can be used to launch the game with controller remappers, overlays, or other third-party utilities.
  * If you're on MacOS or Linux, you can use this to launch the game directly with your compatiblity layer of choice (Wine, Proton, etc).

### Advanced Validation

The Game Builds tab gives you an overview of the FusionFall versions that you have installed.
All functionality from 'Edit Game Builds' menu in the old client is here, along with several improvements and new features:
  * You can manage game caches and offline caches for all versions of FusionFall that the launcher knows about.
  * Files that are missing or corrupt for each build will be highlighted in red or yellow respectively.
  * You can now open the folder that each game/offline cache resides in by pressing the blue folder icon.
Please note that OpenFusionLauncher uses a new location by default for game and offline caches. As mentioned above, this can be changed in the settings.
As a result, you can expect a one-time redownload of the game on first launch.

### Performance & Fixes
* The framerate of the game is now uncapped. Historically, FusionFall has been locked to a maximum framerate of 64 FPS.
  * This should not cause any issues, but if it does you can disable it in the new launcher settings page (game tab).
* The launcher can now run natively on other (non-Windows) platforms. Standalone Linux and MacOS builds will be made available soon.
* Occasional game file corruption or black screens due to zombie launcher processes should no longer occur.
* Users with a default system language other than English should no longer have crashes or a black screen when launching the game.

## OpenFusion v2.0
We are also happy to announce a new release of OpenFusion. This release is tagged as version 2.0 to align with OpenFusionLauncher.
OpenFusion v2.0 brings all the functionality needed for an OpenFusion server to be an endpoint server, along with various other improvements.

### Changelog
* Endpoint server (ofapi) support
  * Support for cookie-based authentication as an alternative or replacement to plaintext password login.
  * Database columns for account email and time of last password change.
* Better player name handling
  * Name wheel names are now validated serverside for increased security.
  * Separate config options for auto-approving name wheel names and custom names for the Original version of the game.
  * The monitor port now sends name request events whenever a player requests a name that is not auto-approved.
  * Players with pending name requests now show up as "Player #" in server logs and other locations where they may not have before.
* Mob AI fixes
  * Fixed a bug where pathed mobs may not start moving from their spawn point.
  * Fixed a bug where mobs would sometimes respawn before they're supposed to.
  * Fixed a bug where mobs would cancel eruption attacks when no targets are in range.
* Security sandbox
  * An error message will now be printed on seccomp sandbox violations.
  * Add support for Landlock to the sandbox. This improves security regarding filesystem and network access.
  * Add a make target to build without Landlock, as well as the sandbox feature altogether.
* Build process
  * Docker builds will now automatically disable the sandbox feature to prevent crashes.
  * Docker builds now use Alpine Linux as the base image, decreasing the size while keeping the same functionality.
  * We now build Docker images for both x86_64 and ARM64, useful if you want to deploy on a Raspberry Pi or Apple Silicon Mac.
  * Network ports used for the server are now exposed in the Dockerfile.
* Misc
  * Increased performance when loading into an area with many players or NPCs.
  * The `/bcast` command now treats area types 1 and 2 as global (whole server announcement).
  * There is now a dedicated `bcast` monitor event for usages of `/bcast` and `/announce`.
  * The monitor port is no longer exposed to outside connections by default for increased security.
