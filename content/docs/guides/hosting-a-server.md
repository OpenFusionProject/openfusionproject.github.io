1. Grab `OpenFusionServer-X-Original.zip` or `OpenFusionServer-X-Academy.zip` from [here](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusion/releases/latest), where `X` corresponds to your operating system.
2. Extract it to a folder of your choice, then run `winfusion.exe` (Windows) or `fusion` (Linux) to start the server.
3. Add a new Simple Server to the launcher's list:
    1. For Description, enter anything you want. This is what will show up in the server list.
    2. For Server IP, enter the IP address and port of the login server. If you're hosting and playing on the same PC, this would be `127.0.0.1:23000`.
    3. Lastly Game Version - select `beta-20100104` if you downloaded the original zip, or `beta-20111013` if you downloaded the academy zip.
4. Once you've added the server to the list, connect to it and log in. If the account does not exist yet, it will be created automatically.
