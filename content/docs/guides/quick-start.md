## Windows 10 / 11

### Method A: Installer (Easiest)
1. Download the launcher installer by clicking [here](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher/releases/latest/download/OpenFusionLauncher-Windows-Installer.exe) - choose to run the file.
2. After a few moments, the launcher should open: you will be given a choice between two public servers by default. Select the one you wish to play and click connect.
3. To create an account, switch to the 'Register' tab and enter in your details, then click the Register button. If you have an  account for the server already, you can enter it inside of the 'Log In' tab.
4. Make a new character, and enjoy the game! Your progress will be saved automatically, and you can resume playing by entering the login details you used in step 3. Make sure to verify your email if you want to enable password recovery!

### Method B: Standalone .zip file
1. Download the launcher from [here](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusionLauncher/releases/latest/download/OpenFusionLauncher-Windows-Portable.zip).
2. Extract it to a folder of your choice. Note: if you are upgrading from an older version, it is preferable to start with a fresh folder rather than overwriting a previous install.
3. Run OpenFusionLauncher.exe - you will be given a choice between two public servers by default. Select the one you wish to play and click connect.
4. To create an account, switch to the 'Register' tab and enter in your details, then click the Register button. If you have an  account for the server already, you can enter it inside of the 'Log In' tab.
5. Make a new character, and enjoy the game! Your progress will be saved automatically, and you can resume playing by entering the login details you used in step 4. Make sure to verify your email if you want to enable password recovery!
