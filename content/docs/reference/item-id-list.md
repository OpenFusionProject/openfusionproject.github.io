The following tables list all items that are available in version `beta-20100104` (used on the OpenFusion Original server) and `beta-20111013` (last Academy version).

To spawn an item, the following command can be used (do not include the brackets):

```sh {frame="none"}
/itemN [ITEM TYPE NUMBER - LISTED AT TOP OF TABLE] [ITEM ID] [QUANTITY - LEAVE AS 1]
```

So for example - to spawn the Angel's Prayer back item, use:
```sh {frame="none"}
/itemN 6 3 1
```

Note that spawning in items (as well as most other commands) are disabled on the public OpenFusion Academy server. If you wish to spawn in Academy items, [you can host your own server](/docs/guides/hosting-a-server).
